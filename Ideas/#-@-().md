# # vs. @ vs. ()
In ModHez, #, @, and () have very different meanings.

## \#
\# in Modhez means something **static** is gonna happen.
"Static" refers to:

- **Anything is embedded**
- **Everything is reproducable and dermestic**
- **It all happens at the top of a file or function**

## @
@ in ModHez means something **dynamic** is gonna happen. It can be put anywhere in the file.

## ()
() is just for functions. Can be put anywhere.
