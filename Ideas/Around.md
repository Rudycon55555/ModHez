# Oriented Around
ModHez will be oriented around many things, and this explains all of them.

## Functions
All code must be inside a function. The only execption is if you are _calling_ the functions, 
but even then, every function call must be inside a function, and theo nly function
you can call from _outside_ a function is `Main()`.

## Commands
All code should be as simple as a command.

## Modules
Unlike OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), ModHez will be centered around
**Modular Hierarchies**.

## Happieness
The developer, the reader, a beginner, a helper, a friend ⸻ they all need
to feel happy and *understand* the code.
