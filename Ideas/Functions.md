# Functions
Functions are a **core part** of ModHez.

## What's Inside
All of the ModHez code.

## Making One
You can make a function with:
```ModHez
function NameHere(parameters, here) {
     *(... code ...
}
```

## Calling One
You can call a function from inside a function or from outside of one.
```ModHez
NameHere(parameters, here) {
     *(... data ...
}
```

## Main()
This is the main commander function of the program and the only one that can be called from outside a function.
