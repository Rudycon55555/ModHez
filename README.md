# ModHez
This has an `Ideas/` folder, with Markdown-formatted files for ideas ModHez could have. ModHez is a coding language transpiled into Zig. The transpiler (Modder, which should use a Modderfile in the project root) will bundle the Zig compiler, so it can immediatly transpile the code and generate build.zig and build.zig.zon and run `zig build`.

## Transpilers
The toolchain will be made by the community via Pull Requests (PRs) with the folder `Toolchains/<your username here>/<version>/`
